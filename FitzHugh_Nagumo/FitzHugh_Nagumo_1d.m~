% Equations:
% dv/dt = D*grad(v) + v*(v-a)*(v-1) - w - I(t)
% dw/dt = eps*(v-gamma*w)
%
% Variables & Parameters:
% v(x,t): membrane potential
% w(x,t): blocking mechanism
% D:      diffusion rate of potential
% a:      threshold potential
% gamma:  resetting rate
% eps:    strength of blocking
% I(t):   initial condition for applied activation

% Parameters in model %
D = 1.0;        % Diffusion coefficient
a = 0.3;        % Threshold potential
gamma = 1;      % Resetting rate
eps = 0.001;    % Blocking strength
I_mag = 0.05;   % Activation strength

% Discretization/Simulation Parameters %
N = 200;       % # of discretized points
L = 500;        % Length of domain, [0,L]
dx = L/N;       % Spatial Step
x = 0:dx:L;     % Computational Domain

% Temporal  Parameters %
T_final = 10000;      % Sets the final time
Np = 10;              % Set the number of pulses
pulse = T_final/Np;   % determines the length of time between pulses.
NT = 400000;          % Number of total time-steps to be taken
dt = T_final/NT;      % Time-step taken
i1 = 0.475;           % fraction of total length where current starts
i2 = 0.525;           % fraction of total length where current ends
dp = pulse/50;        % Set the duration of the current pulse
pulse_time = 0;       % pulse time is used to store the time that the next pulse of current will happen
IIapp=zeros(1,N+1);   % this vector holds the values of the applied current along the length of the neuron
dptime = T_final/100; % This sets the length of time frames that are saved to make a movie.
