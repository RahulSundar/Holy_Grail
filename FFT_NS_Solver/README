 Equations of Motion:
 D (Vorticity) /Dt = nu*Laplacian(Vorticity)  
 Laplacian(Psi) = - Vorticity                                                       

      Real Space Variables                   Fourier (Frequency) Space                                                          
       SteamFunction: Psi                     StreamFunction: Psi_hat
 Velocity: u = Psi_y & v = -Psi_x              Velocity: u_hat ,v_hat
         Vorticity: Vort                        Vorticity: Vort_hat


 IDEA: for each time-step
       1. Solve Poisson problem for Psi (in Fourier space)
       2. Compute nonlinear advection term by finding u and v in real
          variables by doing an inverse-FFT, compute advection, transform
          back to Fourier space
       3. Time-step vort_hat in frequency space using a semi-implicit
          Crank-Nicholson scheme (explicit for nonlinear adv. term, implicit
          for viscous term)
